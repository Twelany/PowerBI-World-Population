# PowerBI Data Scraping World Population | Power Query Data Analysis

This project explores world population by continents and countries. The data is scraped directly from the internet from 3 web pages (given below). We then load this data in power BI, clean and transform it in Power Query, then present our findings in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

# SOURCES:

You can download an excel file for this data from Github repository,the links are given below. ⭐ Github: https://github.com/Twelany/PowerBI-World-Population
Included in the repository:

- Power BI file
- Excel data file
- PDF dashboard

This data was scraped from the following websites:

- POPULATIONS: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/
- CONTINENTS: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/list-of-countries-by-continent
- CAPITAL CITIES: https://geographyfieldwork.com/WorldCapitalCities.htm

# QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

<h3>KPIs:</h3>

- Total population
- Yearly population change
- Median age
- Urban population

<h3>Questions / Charts:</h3>
<h5>1: Population Density by Country:</h5>
Bar or column chart displaying the population density (people per square kilometer) for different countries.

<h5>2: Geographical Visualization:</h5>
Population by continent

<h5>3: Population by country:</h5>
Treemap representing total population & world population share allocated to each continent.

<h5>4: Migrants Impact on Population:</h5>
Stacked column chart /line chart comparing the net migration effect on population growth Results: - Migration does not show any influence on population growth

<h5>5: Median Age Distribution:</h5>
Donut chart showcasing the distribution of median age across different continents.

##Findings and Insights:

- Population Trends: Identify regions experiencing rapid population growth versus those with stable or declining populations.
- Geographical Insights: Understand which continents contribute the most to the global population and how population density varies.
- Migration Impact: Determine if migration has a significant effect on population growth or if other factors dominate.
- Demographic Shifts: Explore how median age varies across continents, reflecting demographic trends such as aging populations in Europe and North America compared to younger populations in Africa and Asia.
