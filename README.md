# PowerBI Data Scraping World Population | Power Query Data Analysis

This project explores world population by continents and countries. The data is scraped directly from the internet from 3 web pages (given below). We then load this data in power BI, clean and transform it in Power Query, then present our findings in an interactive Power BI dashboard.
